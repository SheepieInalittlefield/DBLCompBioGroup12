Basic workflow for using GitHub is as follows: 
Clone the repository to your computer, so you have a local copy. 
Make changes in this local copy
Commit those changes
Push your commits into the online repository 
You can also pull changes from github into your local copy, to make sure it's up to date. 
Always make changes in your local copy first and only push onto the online version once you're certain it works. By doing this it's very hard to accidentally break something.
This is a good guide for using git https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
